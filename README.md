🌟 Day 2: Web Development Journey at Cognifyz Technologies 💻✨
  Continuing my Web Development Internship, I successfully completed Task 1: HTML Structure and Basic Server Interaction – Step 2: Set Up a Simple Node.js Server Using Express! 🎯
  This step introduced me to the fundamentals of creating a lightweight server using Node.js and Express.js, helping me understand how the backend interacts with the frontend.

🔥 Key Highlights
1️⃣ Node.js Basics 🌐
  Installed and configured Node.js and npm.
  Initialized the project with a package.json file for dependency management.
  Installed Express.js and Nodemon for seamless development.
2️⃣ Building the Server 🛠️
  Created a simple Express server that listens on port 4000.
  Added a basic route (/) to return a "Hello, World!" message.
  Ensured smooth development using Nodemon for live server updates.
3️⃣ Project Structure 📁
  Organized the project files with a proper .gitignore to exclude node_modules.
  Used npm scripts for running the development server.

🌱 Learning Outcomes
✅ Strengthened my understanding of setting up a backend server using Node.js.
✅ Explored Express.js to handle HTTP requests and routes.
✅ Gained hands-on experience in managing dependencies and creating a clean, scalable project structure.
